This is another separate offshoot of the WormDrive series that is designed to be simpler with less build complexity.. rather than the large amount of small bearings and screws 
It uses only 2 pieces of M5 screws (One 10mm and One 16mm) for the height lock and the Lower/Base Lock and 14 needles in total
It's a print in place design with only one catch being you need a well calibrated printer not to overextrude and cause jams and rough movement
Printing these it's recommended to go with 100% infill if possible but if not, minimum 20% and it's recommended to use PETG as it's smoother with less friction and to print at lower layer heights
0.12mm Layer Heights with 100% Infill with PETG is recommended highly 
Just print it all, attach the needles to the needle holder, then the needle holder to the gears in the Upper Body and the slide the Height Adjustment Block into the slot on the Upper Body
Followed by attaching the Lower/Base then the Lower/Base Lock and thread the M5x10 to the locking block and the M5x16 to the Height Adjustment Block
Cut your needles to your taste or leave it at full length, both are okay...
Enjoy the easier WormDrive AUTOWDT 
**DISCLAIMER: THERE ARE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE V5 AUTOWDT and the EZ V1, due to the gear design being different and the lack of fixed wiper needles!!!**

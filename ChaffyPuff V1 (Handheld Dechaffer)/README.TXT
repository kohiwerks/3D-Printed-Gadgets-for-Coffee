This is a 3D printed handheld dechaffer that is a cylinder with a port for use with a handheld puffer/blower or to be blown with an airbrush or handblown directly 
It uses the principles of a cyclone generator and provides a strong cyclone only strong enough to move lightweight particles (coffee chaff) and not coffee grounds 
It features 2 parts, a lid for shaking and the main body... 
Print it using food safe materials and at anywhere from a minimum of 20% Infill but it is mandatory to print it at 0.12 or even lower layer heights for smoothness (best would be 0.05)
PLA is best for this....

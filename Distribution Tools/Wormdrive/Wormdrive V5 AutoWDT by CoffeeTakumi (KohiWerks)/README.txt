It uses M3x12 bolts for the gears and the two fixed needles are with M3x8 or M3x10 (both work due to the long thread paths)
The quantity is as follows;
- 4 pieces of the M3x12 Bolts
- 2 pieces of the M3x10 or M3x8 Bolts
- 1 pieces of the 608ZZ Bearing on the Upper Body
- 4 pieces of 683ZZ Bearings on the Spindle
- 1 pieces of the M5x10 and M5x16 for both the height adjustment and stopper for the portafilter ring
- That's about it..... except 13 Needles cut to 40mm (35 or 30 if you're okay with potentially missing out on 3 shot baskets, to be fair, who even uses this most of the time??)

For assembly, just place the 683ZZ bearings into the spindle, then fasten the gears to the spindle, followed by the fixed needle holders to the spindle
Then push the 608ZZ bearing into the Upper, Then push the spindle into the Upper, Then add the needles, Then attach the height adjustment block into Upper, then the Lower to the Upper
Then attach the lower lock, and then add the M5x16 bolt to the height adjustment block, then the M5x10 to the lower lock.... and then fine tune your needle height for the basket........
Attach the top handle, unless you prefer to just spin the spindle directly but a better ergonomic experience is the handle, also adjust the position of your fixed needles to the outer rim of the baskets
